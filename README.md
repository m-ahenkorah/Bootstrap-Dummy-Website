# Frontend Bootcamp Website - Bootstrap 5

> Simple one page website for a fake bootcamp

    I built after going throught the youtube tutorial by Traversy Media.

    I learnt how to use bootstrap to build a complete website from the navbar to the hero-section, to the footer.

    I added classes to make the site responsive at the large, medium and small screen size.

    I used features such as the grid and flexbox to layout the various sections and divs on the website.
